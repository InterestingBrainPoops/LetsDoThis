# LetsDoThis  
## Where to find this project  
This project is hosted on heroku [here](https://letsdothisbois.herokuapp.com).  
## Local Build instructions  
So, to get this project up and running, all you gotta do is do these two commands and then go to localhost:3000.  
And these commands are after you cloned or extracted the repo, and have navigated to the root folder of the project.  
```bash
npm i
node index.js
```
WASD is the controls.  
Use the mouse to aim and fire.  
L brings up the leaderboard.  
## Reccomendations  
My next reccomendation is to open up muliple localhost tabs, becuase of the way that I made the player view system, the player is locked to the center of the screen.  
  
## The development cycle  
I plan on pushing a new meaningful feature once a day at least.  
And unless the feature is a mega overhaul/refactor or something along those lines, then I would mention it in the previous commit or update the README.
