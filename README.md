# LetsDoThis  
## Lets Get started  
So, to get this project up and running, all you gotta do is do these two commands and then go to localhost:3000.  
And these commands are after you cloned or extracted the repo, and have navigated to the root folder of the project.  
```bash
npm i
node index.js
```
WASD is the controls.  
## Reccomendations
My next reccomendation is to open up muliple localhost tabs, becuase of the way that I made the player view system, the player is locked to the center of the screen.  
## Credits
I used external libraries, so here they are:  
[socket.io](https://socket.io),  
[p5.js](https://p5js.org),  
and [victor.js](http://victorjs.org)
